# CvarTesting

This repository contains code that tests various features of Cvar and the Windows API. It is intended to be a test project for my personal learning.

## Project structure

The project directory structure is as follows:
The project consists of a Visual Studio solution called `WindowsProject.sln`, which contains a single project called `WindowsProject`. The project is organized into two main directories:

- `src`: Contains the source code for the project, including the Cvar and Windows API tests.

- `WindowsProject`: Contains the project files, including the Visual Studio project file (`WindowsProject.vcxproj`) and the `.clang-format` file for code formatting.

## Requirements

To compile and run the code in this repository, you will need:

- A C++ compiler that supports C++17 or later.

- The Windows SDK, which includes the necessary header files and libraries for working with the Windows API.

- Visual Studio 2019 or later, if you want to modify the project files or use the Visual Studio IDE.

## Usage

To compile and run the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `WindowsProject.sln` solution file in Visual Studio.

3. Build the project by selecting the `Build` menu and choosing `Build Solution`.

4. Run the `WindowsProject.exe` file located in the `WindowsProject/Debug/` or `WindowsProject/Release/` directory, depending on your build configuration.

   Alternatively, you can run the executable files for the Cvar and Windows API tests located in the `WindowsProject/Debug/` or `WindowsProject/Release/` directories.

## Contributing
